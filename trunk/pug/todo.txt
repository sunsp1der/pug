bugs: 
	leftover items in scene graph after deleting both layers
	sometimes selections still not showing up
	crash - selecting an object while changing selectionwin to another view 

later: 
	#TODO: integer agui (with spinners?)
		range
	#TODO: float agui
		range
	make progress bar move during load
		loading window... update by percentage in postinit
	add component label
		show in parenthesis in dropdown
		add component(label)
			if label in components.labellist, replace
			on codexport no need to delete
		update archetype:
			if you have a dupe component and new class has label, label the dupe
		has_duplicate_of(comp, check_label=True)
		use gname?
		find_by_label
	view a rect from a sprite?
	sort ignoring capitals? (attributes in puglist)
	clearer main.py
		init function where possible... pug_opioid.util
			import all object classes and scene classes
	Tools menu 
		code viewer
		make object into component/base/gnamed object
	component view
		use default of highest level ancestor
			eliminate most string _pugclass type stuff
		add view options of all sub-classes
		open button in label
	remove close option from main windows
	change name 'template' to 'view'
	open console window
	avoid adding right on top of another instance of same thing 
		(move one big nudge down and to right)
	font size for scene class
	make opioid not respond during modal stuff
	set_attribute callback for template
		archetype
			update scenegraph
			inquire about name
		option to cancel
		intercept at base level?
	make objects imports absolute
	editable code_storage
	warn about duplicate gnames
	multiple selection
	easy import for scenes and objects would be nice, too
	custom menu creation
		in templates:
		'menus': {'__order__':[],name1:[]...,name2:[]...}
	make pugwindow faster by making labels a separate sizer?
	key/input event registry in scene
	create groups gui for scene	
	create get_groups function for pugsprite... checks against scene groups
	collision
	kb control in dropdowns
		enter in dropdowns to apply
		needs to post event
	tooltips for component tree
	validators for pug data
	option to open editor from pugwindow
	function to open browser for tutorial
	sort component browser
	make very simple editor interface... 
		ctrl-c, ctrl-v, ctrl-x, delete (on scenegraph too... maybe pass off)
		grid and snap-to
	add soupascript functionality to pug.base_object
		^^ indicates gnamed object
		** indicates python code to eval
		way to indicate filter?
	make subobjects work for code storage... move components to end
	code_storage list ala templates... no functionality in object
	create example out of opioid bricks
		write basic tutorial - Using pug as a level builder
	app = showPugFrame/getPugFrame should return lists
	log all exceptions that are glossed over by automation
	file agui
		allow text entry in 
		show absolute path in tooltip
	refactor scene and object dict into utils, only store strings in dropdowns
	code_storage_exporter.is_exportable
		check lists recursively
		check dicts for keys and items
		keep list of checked stuff... recursive = NO!
	auto-refresh -- leave the attribute being editted alone
	project windows... show all frames available
	particles
	list agui
		create accessor object
			listob.item1
			dictob.str(key)
	component upgrades
		allow option for not adding component_methods to object
		allow option to add attributes as well as methods
		make component system something you can add on later
			not necessary to derive
	
	
not understand:

looks:
	
r&d:
	integrate pycrust for editor
	
useability:
	code_storage dict features: 
		refactor get_storage_info... totally unneccessary
		derive class from CodeStorageExporter instead of customfunc
	allow template to specify 'persist' so as not to use proxies
	allow Routine aguidict 'argstring' instead of arguments
	add refresh object option to pug view - to refresh actual puglist
	make subobject subobject_small and subobject show ala components
	list,dictionary,and tuple attribute guis can also work like components
	make code_export functions and dicts separate from obj's?
		reason would be to take out of release version
	
big needs later... help from outside?:
	undo/redo system
	
Opioid Questions:
	how to get exception messages
	closing a vector pug causes crash
	order of nodes in a given layer is semi-random

	talk about ways to separate runtime game code
		study egg system
	nice way to register/add components to a project
		wait for 3k
	how to doc component attributes
		use properties, look at class
	singletons
		don't need to be marked global
		could be created at search time
			
Wx Questions:
	don't auto-scroll on scrolledPanel
		intercept focus event?	
	how to turn OFF a damn tooltip
