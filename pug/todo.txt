	trying to look at a SpriteRect causes crash	

later: 
	grid and snap-to
	make component_methods pythonic by removing argument processing
	add soupascript functionality to pug.base_object
		^ indicates gnamed object
		* indicates python code
		way to indicate filter?
	make subobjects work for code storage... move components to end
	put gname in instantiation line as gname= argument
	only create one dummy node
		make dummyList a dummyDict... class: dummy
		check for class before creating dummy
	code_storage list ala templates... no functionality in object
	create example out of opioid bricks
		write basic tutorial - Using pug as a level builder
	app = showPugFrame/getPugFrame should return lists
	make very simple editor interface... 
		ctrl-c, ctrl-v, ctrl-x, delete
	log all exceptions that are glossed over by automation
	indent text a little to make it not push into left edge in big labels
	make standalone work right
		app should not auto-close when no windows and no projectwindow
			or frame should automatically create app if none exists
		pug.frame() should work (on principle)
		pug.frame(obj) should work WITHOUT creating app
	create tab-style gui
		refactor pugframe into pugview
		multiple objects in one window...
		when tab is switched check that object is the same, then refresh
	editable code_storage
	file agui
		allow text entry in 
		show absolute path in tooltip
	refactor scene and object dict into utils, only store strings in dropdowns
	code_storage_exporter.is_exportable
		check lists recursively
		check dicts for keys and items
		keep list of checked stuff... recursive = NO!
	sprite does settings after it shows up in corner
	make component system something you can add on later
		not necessary to derive
		components should not keep objects alive
		make sure component object can be deleted properly
	convert pugframe_opened system to accept  (self, frame, object)
	auto-refresh -- leave the attribute being editted alone
	project windows... show all frames available
	tree frame check for other tree frames
	make sprite groups work
	check for frame opening from post_init vs frame from tree

bugs:
	crash when context help on load scene file
	
	image pug crashes when private atts shown
	little bit of top control hidden
	
not understand:

looks:
	
r&d:
	integrate pycrust for editor
	
useability:
	code_storage dict features: 
		post_init_attributes list, 
		post_init_method (default is __init__)
		properties should ALWAYS be post_init
	allow template to specify 'persist' so as not to use proxies
	allow Routine aguidict 'argstring' instead of arguments
	add refresh object option to pug view - to refresh actual puglist
	'first, use dropdown to select a component to add' error msg when adding''
	make subobject subobject_small and subobject show ala components
	list,dictionary,and tuple attribute guis can also work like components
	create Component and Component Methods pug views
	allow a dictionary when adding a component, containing component attributes
	make code_export functions and dicts separate from obj's?
		reason would be to take out of release version
	
big needs later... help from outside?:
	undo/redo system
