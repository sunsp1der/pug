The Pig Editor allows you to layout your scene and, with the help of components, add quite a bit of functionality. Another way to add functionality to your objects is using *Actions*. Many Actions have to do with object movement, but there are many kinds of Actions available.

  # Start the Pig Editor by running edit_project.py
  # Select PigSprite in the _Object to add_ dropdown in
